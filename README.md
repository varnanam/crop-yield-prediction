# crop-yield-prediction

web link: http://varnanamahesh.pythonanywhere.com/

Abstract:Throughout the existence of agriculture, one of the main issues of interest to farmers was the issue of increasing crop yield.The crop yield of plants 
relies on different factors like climatic elements, geographical,organic, political and  financial elements. Climate and other environmental changes have become
a major threat in the agriculture field.
This data set aims at predicting the yield of the crop from historical available data like temperature,pesticide use, rainfall and historic crop yield.We achieved
this using a suitable machine learning algorithm. The  proposed approach  will  implement techniques  and algorithms  like Linear, Ridge and LASSO, Support vector,
Random Forest and Decision Tree Regression and choose the best fit model for the prediction based on accuracy.
